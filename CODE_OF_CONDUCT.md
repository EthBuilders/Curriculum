## Code of Conduct

📜 Our Code of Conduct is the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org)

Furthermore, we have extended it to suit the needs of our community, as seen below.

These apply for our meetings and open source initatives.

We will review this beginning of every Meetup and meeting.

## Extended Code of Conduct

🧭 **Our Community’s Goal**: build the Ethereum community and provide a space where people can learn by doing.  
🔑 **Prerequisite**: you abide by our code of conduct and culture detailed below.  
🎟️ **Membership**: contingent on having **weekly active works** within the Ethereum community and related technologies.  

🛠️ We are action-oriented. The best time to start is now. Welcome!

## Culture

🏗️ We have a culture of:
1. Intellectual curiosity, especially hands-on learning
2. Calculated risk-taking with a supportive environment
3. Experimentation and iteration
4. Failing fast and failing often
5. Paying it forward and helping others
6. Collaboration and sharing without blocking others
7. A sense of wonder and focus.
8. Free speech and thinking matched with mutual politeness.
9. Have fun and have a sense of humor
10. Resilience, since technology has booms and bust cycle
11. Polite and welcoming behavior
12. Intellectual humility

### Free Speech and Order

*Free speech + order = progress  
🗽      We value freedom of speech.  
🏛️      However, this freedom rests on order, respect and ethics.  
🤬 🚫 Free speech is NOT an excuse for acting like a jerk.

### ⚖️ *Polite behavior explained

Follow the golden rule and the silver rule.  
Silver rule: “Do not do unto others as you would not have them do unto you”  
Golden rule: “Treat others as you would like others to treat you”.  

### *Welcoming behavior explained

Create a respectful environment where people want to come, stay, and participate for the long term.  

### *Sharing and collaboration explained

**Silver rule of sharing**: “Share your stuff now, unless you want to have no help when you really are in trouble”.  
Basically, you get what you give.  
Build your social capital.  
If we all give more than we get, our community will grow and benefit everyone.  

### *Intellectual Humility Explained

Not everyone knows everything. 
Just because you know X, does not mean you know Y.  
Don’t put people down for asking questions, even basic ones.  
See Dunning Kruger effect.

### ⚙️ Operating Rules

1. Don’t interrupt or talk over people, especially if you didn’t bring anything to show.  
2. Respect each other. Talk to each other the way you would in real life or being recorded.  
3. Allow others the time to speak.  
4. Bring what you have done in the community this week.  
5. Do the assignment if one was assigned.  
6. NO talking about price.  
7. NO talking about the value of Ethereum or Bitcoin.  
We are focused on building things, not being bogged down in arguments of value. If you have questions, comments or concerns add ONLY new ideas or questions to this document here.  

### 🎟️ Membership

**Membership** is based on having weekly **active works** within the Ethereum community and related technologies.  

Some examples works/contributions for membership:
1. Code: personal or open-source
2. Learning about Ethereum and then applying this learning in a concrete form
3. Content generation
4. Evangelism
5. Meme building
6. Presentation of topic related to the ecosystem.
7. Trading your own accounts in DeFi
8. Active interaction with tools based on Ethereum and related communities not mentioned here.

#### Member introductions

Our goal is to build rapport, get to the agenda AND finish on time.

1. Keep to 30 seconds MAX.
2. Only those who did something in the community may introduce themselves.  
3. ALL introductions will happen in the chat upon entering video chat to keep things moving along.  

#### Meetup Townhall Introduction Template

When the meetup starts, please write your introduction in the chatbox. That way everyone can refer to it later if needed.
