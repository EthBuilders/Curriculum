| ⚠️ | All-Time High (ATH) | The highest price a of a cryptocurrency or asset in a qoute currency, such as US Dollar, BTC, or ETH. |
| ⚠️ | Allocation | The portion of tokens or equity, that may be earned, purchased, or set aside for certain entities or activites. These entities can be investors, teams, organizations, or communities. |
| ⚠️ | Alpha (software) | The first look at a product in a very basic form released by a team. Often used in software industry. |

| ⚠️ | Application-Specific Integrated Circut (ASIC) | A customized integrated circuit (aka chip) designed for maximum performance in a specific area instead of general computation. Usually used to create customized mining equipment for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency networks to maximize rewards through increased hash power.  |
| ⚠️ | Arbitrage | Buying and selling an asset in different markets to profit from the price difference. Buy low in one market, sell at a higher price in another. |
| ⚠️ | ASIC-resistant | A cryptocurrency whose procotol mining algorithm is configured to remove any advantage from using ASIC machines when compared to GPU mining.

This effectively replaces a traditional limit order-book with a system where assets can be automatically swapped against the pool’s latest price.
There are two main types of automated market makers. One may be governed and set up by professional market makers, and the other is fully automated by an algorithm, allowing any user in the market to participate by depositing liquidity into the smart contract. |

### [B](##table)

It's software in development between the alpha phase and the release phase. It's generally considered "complete" by the developer that is not ready for general use due to a lack of testing. |
| 👷 | Bid price |  The price that a prospective buyer is prepared to pay for a securities or other asset. A bid price is generally arrived at through a process of negotiation between the seller and buyer. Prices are designed to a desirable outcome from the entity making the bid. When multiple buyers bid, it can develop into a bidding war; eventually, the price becomes settled when a buyer makes an offer which a rival is unwilling to top. In the context of stock trading, the bid price refers to the highest amount of money a prospective buyer is willing to spend on it.  |
| ⚠️ | Bid-ask spread | TBD |
| ⚠️ | Bitcoin | An immutable and trustless ledger made up of a decentralized network of nodes to manage and issue a global digital currency that mimics gold's property of scarcity via a hard limit of 21 million coins.

It is the first successful attempt at issuing decentralized currency, non-fiat, non-state actor currency which solves the double-spend problem.|
| 👷 | Bitcoin core | Bitcoin Core consists of both “full-node” software for fully validating the blockchain as well as a bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin Core is programmed to decide which blockchain contains a valid transaction. Users of Bitcoin Core only accept transactions for that blockchain, making it the Bitcoin blockchain that everyone else to use.

Since prices continuously rise and fall during trading, the classification of "bull market" is reserved for extended amounts of time where a large portion of prices are rising.  |
| 👷 | Bull Trap | A bull trap is a signal that proves to be false by indicating that a decreasing trend in a stock or index has reversed and is starting upward. However, the trend continues going down. Traders acting on this buy signal can be trapped and generate losses on long positions. |

DAOs are conducted by smart contracts that are governed by the collective work of its contributors and community members by enabling the creation of a more efficient system reducing the need for human input, overall costs, and risk related to human behavior.

| ⚠️ | Seed Phrase | TBD |
| 👷 | Seed round | Considered the earliest offical round of financing for a startup, in which the main sources of capital are typcially angel investors or institutions specialized in seed funding - corporate or venture capitial seed funds, accelerators, institutional crowdfunding platforms. Financing amount can typically range from $100 thousand to $5 million. Startups in seed round generally have validated a proof of concept or MVP to have a fit in the market, and have idenified the requirements (e.g., skillset, technology, partnerships) to build out the product. |
| ⚠️ | Segregated Witness (SegWit) | TBD |
| 👷 | Selfish Mining |  a miner or group of miners increases their revenue by strategically withholding and releasing blocks to the network. Typically, a miner will announce a block as soon as they find it. If the block is confirmed, they get a reward for the block.
The goal of shelfish mining is to remain at least one block ahead of the network. Nodes accept the chain with the most accumulated proof of work as a valid blockchain. Anytime, the selfish miner can reveal their chain is longer than the one followed by the rest of the network, the existing blocks are discarded and the transaction becomes reversed. The miner then collects the reward and cause other parties to waste their resources. |
| ⚠️ | Sell Wall | TBD |
| ⚠️ | Sentiment | TBD |
| 👷 | Series A | Financing round that occurs after a seed round and is often the first round in which venture capital investors are involved. This round can include multiple investors, in which one typically leads the process and receives a higher amount of equity/ownership level in return. Financing amount can have a large range from $10 million to even a few billion depending on the startup's offerings and industry. Startups at Series A generally have a completed product, established userbase, and revenue generation, and seek funding to support further product and/or business model development, cover costs of production or market expansion prior to becoming revenue financed. |
| 👷 | Series B | Financing round that occurs after the Series A round and involves similar type of investors and similar process. Startups at Series B have validated the product-market fit, established business operations, and have a growing customer base. Startups in this financing round generally seek financing to scale up business operations, hire additional staff, and tackle growing competition. |
| 👷 | Series C | Financing round that occurs after a Series B, involves venture capital firms, and is typically the last round of private equity financing, though additional rounds may occur prior to an IPO. The process takes the same form as Series B - one venture capital fund leading the process that can involve multiple other venture capital funds. Startups in this financing round are generally successful in with their current offerings and current market, and seek funding to develop new offerings, expand into new markets, or acquire new businesses. |
| 👷 | Sharpe Ratio | A metric to understand the performance (rate of return) associated to risk of a portfolio or asset. It assumes that there is a risk free rate of return available, such as the yield for a US Treasury bond. It also assumes that volatility of rate of return (represented as a standard deviation) is equal to risk. It is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate of return from the total rate of return and dividing by the standard deviation of the expected rate of return. A lower Sharpe ratio indicates performance due to higher risk and a higher Sharpe ratio indicates performance due to lower risk. When comparing portfolios and assets, those with a higher Sharpe ratio are considered favorable as their returns come from good investment rather than high risk. |

| 👷 | Venture Capital | A form of private equity financing in which institutional investors or high net worth individuals provide an investment to a entrepreneur or startup in return for some level of equity or ownership of the venture. In the blockchain space, ownership can be in the form of traditional stock & cap tables or can be in the form of token distribution models. The investment provided by the VC entity is typically monetary but can also be non-monetary such as technical or managerial support. The goal of venture capital is to provide early stage venture (i.e., high risk) with the capital necessary to build and scale in return of potential high reward.  |
| ⚠️ | Virtual Machine | TBD |
| ⚠️ | Volatility | A measure of the price fluctuations or rate of return over a time period of an asset or portfolio. Modern Portfolio Theory assumes that volatility is equal to risk - higher volatily means higher risk. |
| ⚠️ | Volume | A measure of how much an asset is exchanged over a period of time. This measurement can be in the form of the number of shares of an asset exchanged or the value of the number assets exchanged. In crypto, volume is generally presented as the value of the number of cryptocurrency assets exchanged, with value represented as either US Dollar, Bitcoin, or Ethereum. |
